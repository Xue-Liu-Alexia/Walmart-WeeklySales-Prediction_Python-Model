# How Walmart uses Big Data?
Improving Store Checkout: By using Predictive Analysis, the stores can anticipate demand at a certain week and determine how many Sales Representatives / Employees are needed.
Managing the Steps of Supply Chain: The company optimizes the routes to the shipping dock and tracks the number of times the product is accessed before it reaches the Customer's destination. Also, it uses the data to analyze transportation lanes and routes for the company's trucks. These data help Walmart keep transportation costs down and schedule an appropriate time for drivers.
Optimizing Product Assortment: By analyzing customer preferences and shopping patterns, Walmart accelerates the decision-making on how to maintain stocks. Big Data provides insights on new items and discontinued products.
Personalizing Shopping Experience: With Big Data, Walmart analyzes the shopping preferences of the customers to develop a consistent and delightful shopping experience.
